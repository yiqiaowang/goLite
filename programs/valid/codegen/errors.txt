1. Printing runes - Prints (random?) characters instead of ints [TEST: init_and_print.go]
2. Printing struct fields - If there is a struct that looks like:
type x struct {
	y int
}

and we do

var herp x

println(herp.y) -> Prints undefined

[TEST: pass_by_value.go]

3. Multiple assignments - swap behaviour [TEST: multiple_assigns.go]
